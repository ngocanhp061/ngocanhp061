Home Credit is a leading mass market consumer finance provider.

  **1. SWOT analysis**

**1.1. Strengths**

Good Risk Management: Non-Performing Loan (NPL) ratio at Home Credit is always below 3% (sometimes only 2%).
Diversifying financial products, allowing customers to choose prepayment fee (from 10-50% the value of the item), and to choose a loan term (from 6-36 months).
Take the first steps in digital transformation (using AI, Big Data, ..), have customer understanding and sustainable development goals.

**1.2. Weaknesses**
Home Credit is a company with 100% foreign capital, so this company does not have supporting parents, which are big banks in Vietnam => have difficulties in accessing customer files and preferential loans.

**1.3. Oppotunities**
Opportunities to develop sections in the consumer finance sector, because Vietnam's consumer finance market will continue to expand due to the fact that 69% vietnamese population do not have access to banking services.

**1.4. Threats**
Higher interest rate than traditional banks.

<!---->
Threats from industry competitors: The group of companies that prioritize profit growth will focus on expanding market share by accelerating loan balance growth.
The State Bank is going to tighten the cash lending activities of financial companies.
Customers have a fearful view of financial companies and consumer loans, because this form is not really popular in Vietnam.

  **2. PESTEL Analysis**

**2.1. Political**
Political is stable in Vietnam, with the State willing to create tight legal corridors to promote consumer lending and push back "black credit".

**2.2. Economic**
Consumer lending has a close relationship with the economy. Vietnam's economy grows, consumers satisfy previously pent-up needs, increase the demand for consumer loans. However, there are still increasing risks (including slowing growth, rising inflation) that threaten the outlook for economic recovery.

**2.3. Social**
Many Vietnamese people are still not familiar with consumer lending, so they are easily becoming victims of many online fraud methods. Many low-income people look for consumer loan information advertised on social networks, thereby falling into the traps of scams to take money or becoming debtors of "black credit". This is a big challenge for financial companies.

**2.4. Technological**
Technology has become a driving force, but also a major challenge for consumer finance companies. Thanks to technology (such as AI, Big Data, Machine Learning), consumer finance companies can quickly browse loan applications, bringing convenience to both companies and consumers. However, it is also a challenge for the company to stay up to date with digital transformation, otherwise they will be left behind.

**2.5. Environmental**

**2.6. Legal**
In addition to competitive pressure, the strategic adjustment in the coming time will be understandable for these companies, when the State Bank is collecting comments on the draft circular amending the company's consumer lending regulations, with part of the content being to tighten the cash lending activities of financial companies.

<!---->
According to the draft, financial companies are not allowed to lend cash to customers without credit information. Along with that, the proportion of cash loans should not exceed 30% of the total outstanding loans of financial companies.

<!---->
If this draft is approved, the consumer lending industry will witness a      clear deceleration. Because according to calculations, cash lending activities have a high rate in the products of financial companies. Cash loan ratio of FE Credit is about 80%, which in Home Credit and HD Saison account for 50% and 40%, respectively.

  **3. Market Analysis for Home Credit**
  
In Vietnam, there are currently 16 financial companies licensed by the State Bank of Vietnam, including: FE Credit, Home Credit, HD Saison, Mcredit, Shinhan Finance, Mirae Asset, JACCS,  SHB Finance, Viet Credit, PTF finance, FCCOM, EVN Finance, HAFIC, Lotte Finance Vietnam, VSFC, Toyota Finance Vietnam.

<!---->
The consumer finance market has had a decreasing growth rate, and the level of competition in the market has increased significantly. Although the competition is stronger, the products and services between the competitors are almost the same.  Meanwhile, the difference between these 16 companies is in the development strategy. Currently, the market is divided into two groups, including those that prioritize profit growth and accept high NPL ratio and those that prioritize property quality and capital adequacy.

Despite many negative impacts of Covid-19, Vietnam's consumer finance market continues to be assessed as potential and is expected to recover strongly. The rise of the middle class results in the increase of Vietnam's per capita income on a yearly basis. This is expected to boost consumption growth and indirectly increase the demand of consumer finance in Vietnamese market.

Moreover, at present a large number of people without access to the financial services of traditional banks will become the core driving force for the business activities of financial companies.

Vietnam's consumer finance market will continue to expand due to the fact that, Vietnam ranks second in the world in terms of the number of people who do not have access to banking services, with 69% of Vietnamese population.

  **4. Advantages of consumer lending?**

It increases financial access opportunities for citizens (especially low-income ones, does not have credit history - this is the group of customer who is often denied by traditional banks)
It contributes to increase financial knowledge for new customer groups, the population has little access to banking services => helps them manage well their financial personal transactions, create a platform for them to be ready to use other financial services such as traditional banks' services.

<!---->
It decreases the demand for "black credit".
It is an important tool to stimulate consumption demands, thereby increasing output and creating more job opportunities, contributing to the economic growth of the country.

  **5. Why does consumer lending have higher interest rate?**

This fact is understandable, because of several reasons:
The target customers are individuals.
The scale of consumer lending is often small (suitable with products' price).
The short loan period. (a short period obviously brings higher interest rate than a long one).
The majority of consumer loans are provided in the form of installment loans and are unsecured.
Customers of consumer loans are often people who are difficult or impossible to borrow from commercial banks.
